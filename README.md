# Four in a Row

This is a purportedly ugly remake in Svelte of the acclaimed four-in-a-row game, with portuguese vocals narrated by yours truly in Brazilian Portuguese (the real pt, I mean). Have fun!

## How to run

If you'd like to have a go at the game, first make sure you have node.js installed, alongside with Svelte. Then clone this repo:

> git clone https://github.com/furetosan/ffbsveltehtml.git

Finally, just run your own development server locally:

> npm run dev
